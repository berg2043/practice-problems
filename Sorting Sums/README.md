## Problem

Create a function that takes an string of positive integers and returns a new string sorted differently.  The integers are to be sorted by the sum of their digits ascendingly.  If two integers have the same sum of their respective digits, they should be sorted alphabetically.

## Example:

"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" becomes: "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"

## Notes

It may happen that the input string have leading, trailing whitespaces and 
more than a unique whitespace between two consecutive numbers
